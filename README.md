## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
The initial focus will be on WinUI, but later Xamarin Forms, WPF will also be considered.

- Currently the project is in early developement stage
- Everybody is welcome to try the plugin.
- Everybody is welcome to fork or contribute to the project.
=======
Work under progress.
Currently supporting html with bootstrap

steps to get as much as accurate results:
1. if you used the windows ui kit, you will get the most accure result, hopefully.
2. controls should be components and naming should include a word that indicates the control like button, picker, combo box etc.
