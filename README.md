# AdobeXD plugin to export artboards or selections to html files
## Description

Work under progress.
Currently supporting html with bootstrap

steps to get as much as accurate results:
1. if you used the windows ui kit, you will get the most accure result, hopefully.
2. controls should be components and naming should include a word that indicates the control like button, picker, combo box etc.
